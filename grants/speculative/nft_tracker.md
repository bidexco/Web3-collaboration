# NFT Tracking Module

## Project Description

### Brief Description

The Tracking Module is the core of NFT functionality. Like ERC-721 standard in Ethereum ecosystem, this module provides the basement for creating collections of unique non-divisible things, also called Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs), minting NFT of a given Collection, and managing their ownership.

### Why NFT Tracking Module is Good for the Ecosystem

The NFT Tracking Module is the first step in building NFT Parachain and NFT bigger pucture inside the Polkadot ecosystem. NFT standard ERC-721 is widely used in Ethereum ecosystem for tracking miscellaneous real-world and gaming assets. Having an analogue will speed up transformation of Ethereum based NFT applications towards Polkadot, so it will enable development of new applications.

### How NFT Tracking Module Integrates into Substrate

NFT Tracking Module is the Substrate Runtime module built with substrate-up or similar scripts. 

### Why our Team is Interested

We see Polkadot as a very promissing technology that will be used for a large number of use cases. It will greatly contribute to adoption of blockchain in powerful applications. It is technically one of the most ambitious blockchain projects we know of, and we would like to be part of the community that's creating it, as well as developing on it once the network goes live.

In particular, NFT technology are a great part of our roadmap, which includes integration with Gaming frameworks, building gaming APIs, wallets, etc. NFT Tracking Module will enable next steps in this roadmap.
